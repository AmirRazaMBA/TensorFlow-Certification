    "The dataset includes reviews, and each review is labelled as 0 (bad) or 1 (good). However, in this exercise, you will only work with the reviews, not the labels, to practice tokenizing and sequencing the text. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example good reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.\n",
    "*   Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example bad reviews:  \n",
    "\n",
    "*   A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad\n",
    "*   If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.\n",
